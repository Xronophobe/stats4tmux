# stats4tmux
Some stats of my Linux system I would like to display on Tmux Statusbar while practicing C++

I started this project because my [battchrg.sh](https://github.com/Xronophobe/battchrg) script only supports Mac OS, and also very slow.
This project will display the same battery information in a command line friendly format, among many other features.
